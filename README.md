This is a first attempt to work with my Sony a6700 camera like I work with my remote server: using the shell.

Built on/for Ubuntu 24.04. It uses Sony's official Camera Remote SDK. You can search it or download it here: https://support.d-imaging.sony.co.jp/app/sdk/en/index.html

See the INSTALL file for more info
